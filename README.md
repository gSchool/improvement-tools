### Developer standards

One important aspect to improving quickly is knowing where you are and knowing what your goal is.

[Developer standards](./developer_standards.md) breaks down many different aspects of being a professional developer
into junior, mid-level, and senior proficiencies. By self-assessing where you are and charting a path to get better,
you can focus on improving your competencies.

"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants." - Sir Isaac Newton

In technology, you are constantly using tools and techniques that were developed because people before you
experienced pain and learned lessons from having solved so many different problems. By leaning on their
expertise, you can accelerate your growth and learn new ways of thinking about problems.

While you may be tempted to focus on the technical books, non-technical books can help your
career and thought process much more. Development is just problem solving through code, so you can get
better at code, but getting better at problem solving in all aspects of your life can be extremely beneficial.
